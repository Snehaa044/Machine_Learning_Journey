# Machine Learning Journey 

This repository tracks my learning and progress in Machine Learning.  
I'll be covering Python basics, libraries like NumPy, Pandas, EDA, and core ML algorithms through hands-on coding.

Stay tuned for regular commits and topic-wise folders!

## ğŸ“Œ Phases
- Phase 1: Python
- Phase 2: NumPy
- Phase 3: Pandas
- Phase 4: EDA
- Phase 5: Machine Learning Algorithms
